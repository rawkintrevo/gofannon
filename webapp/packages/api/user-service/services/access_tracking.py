"""Deferred access tracking for the data store.

The data store's read paths (``get``, ``get_all``, ``get_many``)
historically did a save-back inside the loop to bump an
``accessCount`` counter and stamp ``lastAccessedByAgent`` /
``lastAccessedAt``.  That turned a one-shot bulk read into N+1 round
trips and forked the doc revision on every read, defeating both the
HTTP-call savings of bulk APIs and CouchDB's compaction.

This module decouples the tracking from the read path: callers record
intent in an in-memory accumulator, and a periodic background flush
batches all pending updates into one ``save_many()`` call every 10
seconds.

Tradeoffs:

  * Counts are eventually-consistent.  A read followed immediately by
    ``get_all()`` may see a stale ``accessCount``.  Acceptable since
    the field is advisory metadata for the data-store viewer, not
    application-critical state.
  * Unflushed updates are lost on process exit.  No explicit shutdown
    hook because we don't have a graceful-shutdown path on the API
    yet, and adding one for this alone is overkill.  Worst case: the
    last 10 seconds of access counts disappear.
  * The accumulator is process-local.  In a multi-replica deployment
    each replica has its own buffer; counts converge over the next
    flush interval after they migrate to one writer.  Acceptable for
    the same advisory-metadata reason.

Concurrency: the accumulator's mutating methods are guarded by a
``threading.Lock``.  We don't expect contention to be high — the read
side does a single dict insert per access — but this is the simplest
correct model under FastAPI's async + thread-pool execution.
